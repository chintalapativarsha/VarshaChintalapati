# About Me

I am a Computer Science student with a concentration in data science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. I am a senior graduating fall 2024!

# Goals & Objectives

I hope to create a project in this class that will showcase the CS skills that I have learned over my time at UNC Charlotte. My capstone software development project will be a milestone in my academic journey and serve useful in my career pursuits as well.
